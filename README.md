# CycleGAN-image-style-transfer
In this experiment, CycleGAN is used to implement the image style migration task, and the monet2photo,
ukiyoe2photo and vangogh2photo datasets are used to complete the conversion of three styles of images. In order
to further optimise the performance, this paper modifies the training parameters of the model based on CycleGAN,
replaces the structure of the generator network, and re-trains on the monet2photo dataset. The results of the original
model and the improved model are compared through experiments to verify the effectiveness of the improved method.
