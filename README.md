# CycleGAN-image-style-transfer
This was the first time I used CycleGAN to train my own deep learning model, and I was able to complete the training and evaluation of the model for optimization, despite the limited hardware resources! I hope to have more exposure to computer vision and AIGC graph related applications in the future. (^_^Y)

In this experiment, CycleGAN is used to implement the image style migration task, and the monet2photo, ukiyoe2photo and vangogh2photo datasets are used to complete the conversion of three styles of images. In order to further optimise the performance, I modifiy the training parameters of the model based on CycleGAN, replaces the structure of the generator network, and re-trains on the monet2photo dataset. The results of the original model and the improved model are compared through experiments to verify the effectiveness of the improved method.

The repository contains all the datasets, training set data, and training and optimization code. You can directly view my thesis document to get an overview of my research methodology, process and results.
